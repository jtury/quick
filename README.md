# Quick
### [See an example here](https://jtury.github.io/quick/) (try clicking on the links)
This is an experimental repository that shows an implementation of a fast ajax-based preloading system for the web. This software regresses to standard location loading if javascript is disabled. This software's use cases are as follows:
- Personal blogs
- Article lists
- Other template-based content

As of right now, this is experimental and subject to change. Contributions are welcome.

## Goals
- [ ] Toolchain for converting a directory of `.md` files into a quick-compatible site
- [ ] More support for edge cases
- [ ] Faster load times
  - [ ] Options for load behavior (e.g loading on `pointerdown`)
- [ ] Longer cache duration

## Inspiration
This project takes inspiration from GatsbyJS's page prefetching functionality.
